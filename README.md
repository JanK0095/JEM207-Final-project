## The purpose of our project

Our project has three main goals:

* To scrape information about restaurants located in Prague from the web page https://www.zlatestranky.cz/, which is an online catalouge of various firms in the Czech Republic.

* To export the data and save it in a python-fiendly format (DataFrame).

* To provide funcionality to the data, which may be missing from zlatestranky.cz. This might include e.g. possibility to list the restaurants according to ratings, filter them by available payment method or check wheather the restaurant is open at a given time.

## Question for the project discussion

* **Is it better to define class the return entire dataset or, alteratively class called Restaurant (each individual restaurant will be instance of this class)?**

* Is the sample project provided the benchmark, should we take it minimum requirement, or the state-of-the-arts? 

## Master Plan 游눩

### What to do until 20.-21.12.

* gather te phone number, email address, website link, payment methods, services(?) (Honza)

* Write license (Honza)

* Start with OOP (Maty치코)

## Notes

* Not every restaurant has full information available - this might cause problems while scraping
