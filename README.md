- The main aim of this project is to create a comprehensive data set of Prague restaurants using the information available at [Zlaté Stránky](www.zlatestranky.cz).
- In addition, it attempts to match each restaurant to its counterpart in the Google database by utilizing the Google Maps Platforms' Places API. Thus, it extends the obtained data set with additional information.
- Lastly, we provide extensive data interpretation, data visualisation, and an interactive tool to scan through our compiled data set.
- For the structure of our project, please refer to [Project_structure.pdf](Project_structure.pdf).
- The final output of our project is available in [output.ipynb](output.ipynb).
- The compiled data set is available for download in the following [file](data/restaurants_zlatestranky.csv).
